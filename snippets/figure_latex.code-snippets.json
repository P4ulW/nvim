	// Place your global snippets here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a scope, prefix, body and 
	// description. Add comma separated ids of the languages where the snippet is applicable in the scope field. If scope 
	// is left empty or omitted, the snippet gets applied to all languages. The prefix is what is 
	// used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are: 
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. 
	// Placeholders with the same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"latex figure": {
		"scope": "latex",
		"prefix": "figure_latex",
		"body": [
			"\\begin{figure}[h]",
			"\t\\centering",
			"\t\\includegraphics{${1:figure_path}}",
			"\t\\caption{${3:caption}}",
			"\t\\label{fig:${2:label}}",
			"\\end{figure}",
		],
		"description": "create a figure in latex doc"
	}
